# Dense Feature Matching for Visual SLAM
**Evaluation of LoFTR and ELFOTR on Challenging Scenes**

This repository contains the code and results for the BBL 514E Spring 2025 project at Istanbul Technical University. The project benchmarks state-of-the-art dense feature matching models â€” **LoFTR** and **ELFOTR** â€” on visual SLAM-relevant datasets, focusing on their performance in terms of homography estimation and matching reliability.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) requires robust feature matching to estimate camera motion and reconstruct 3D scenes. Traditional feature detectors like ORB and SIFT struggle in low-texture or dynamic environments. In this project, we evaluate **transformer-based detector-free models** for dense matching:

- **LoFTR**: Dense local feature matching without keypoint detection.
- **ELFOTR**: A lightweight, faster version of LoFTR with similar accuracy.

We benchmark their performance on the **MegaDepth1500** and **ScanNet1500** datasets and to assess suitability for SLAM pipelines.
